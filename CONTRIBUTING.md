## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### Python Code Style
- **PEP 8**: Follow Python style guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for all functions
- **Docstrings**: Document all public functions and classes
- **Maximum Line Length**: 88 characters (Black formatter)

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import asyncio

async def process_emails(
    mailbox: str, 
    batch_size: int = 10
) -> List[EmailResult]:
    """
    Process emails from the specified mailbox.
    
    Args:
        mailbox: Email address of the mailbox to process
        batch_size: Number of emails to process in each batch
        
    Returns:
        List of email processing results
        
    Raises:
        EmailProcessingError: If email processing fails
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### Frontend Code Style (TypeScript/React)
- **TypeScript**: Use strict type checking
- **ESLint**: Follow configured linting rules
- **Prettier**: Use consistent code formatting
- **Component Structure**: Follow established patterns

```typescript
interface EmailListProps {
  emails: Email[]
  onEmailSelect: (email: Email) => void
  isLoading?: boolean
}

export function EmailList({ 
  emails, 
  onEmailSelect, 
  isLoading = false 
}: EmailListProps): JSX.Element {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Security Guidelines

#### Sensitive Data Handling
- **Never commit credentials**: Always use environment variables
- **Sanitize test data**: Remove personal information from test cases
- **Validate inputs**: Implement proper input validation
- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use appropriate encryption for stored data

#### Example: Sanitizing Test Data
```python
# ‚ùå Don't do this
test_email = "john.doe@realcompany.com"

# ‚úÖ Do this instead
test_email = "testuser@example.com"
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Coverage
- **Minimum 80%**: Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

#### Test Structure
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch

class TestEmailProcessor:
    """Test cases for email processing functionality."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_email_data(self):
        """Provide sanitized test email data."""
        return {
            "from": "testuser@example.com",
            "subject": "Test email subject",
            "body": "Test email body content"
        }
    
    async def test_process_email_success(self, mock_email_data):
        """Test successful email processing."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
        
    async def test_process_email_failure(self):
        """Test email processing error handling."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

## üîÑ Contribution Workflow
