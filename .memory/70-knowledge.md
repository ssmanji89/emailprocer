## Domain Knowledge

### Email Classification & Escalation
**Email Classification**: The process of automatically categorizing incoming emails based on content, sender, urgency, and business rules to determine appropriate handling procedures.

**Escalation Management**: A systematic approach to routing high-priority or complex emails to appropriate teams or individuals based on predefined criteria such as SLA requirements, expertise needed, or workload distribution.

**SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: Contractual commitments defining response times and resolution targets for different types of email inquiries, typically measured in hours or business days.

**Team Assignment Algorithm**: AI-powered system that recommends optimal team assignments based on current workload, expertise matching, availability, and historical performance data.

### Real-time Processing
**WebSocket Communication**: Bidirectional communication protocol enabling real-time updates between client and server without polling, essential for live escalation notifications and status updates.

**Event-driven Architecture**: System design pattern where components communicate through events, enabling loose coupling and real-time responsiveness for escalation workflows.

**Auto-reconnection Logic**: Fault-tolerance mechanism that automatically re-establishes WebSocket connections using exponential backoff to ensure reliable real-time communication.

## Technical Terminology

### Frontend Architecture
**Component Composition**: Building complex UI elements by combining smaller, reusable components following the single responsibility principle.

**State Management**: Coordinating data flow between components using React hooks, localStorage for persistence, and WebSocket subscriptions for real-time updates.

**Type Safety**: Using TypeScript to prevent runtime errors through compile-time type checking, ensuring data integrity across the application.

**Accessibility (a11y)**: Implementing WCAG 2.1 AA standards through proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

### Integration Patterns
**API Client Pattern**: Centralized service layer for all HTTP communications, providing consistent error handling, type safety, and request/response transformation.

**Service Layer**: Abstraction layer for external integrations (Microsoft Teams, export services) that encapsulates business logic and provides clean interfaces.

**Progress Tracking**: User experience pattern for long-running operations that provides real-time feedback and cancellation capabilities.

## Development Practices

### Code Organization
```typescript
// Standard component structure
'use client'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { ComponentProps } from '@/types/api'
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api-client'
import { formatTimeAgo } from '@/lib/utils'

export function ComponentName({ prop }: ComponentProps) {
  // 1. State declarations
  // 2. Effect hooks
  // 3. Event handlers
  // 4. Render logic with proper error/loading states
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```typescript
// Consistent async error handling
const handleAsyncOperation = async () => {
  try {
    setIsLoading(true)
    const result = await apiClient.operation()
    setData(result)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Operation failed:', error)
    // User-friendly error feedback
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}
```

### Utility Function Standards
- **formatTimeAgo()**: Human-readable relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- **formatDuration()**: Convert seconds to human format (e.g., "2h 30m")
- **formatPercentage()**: Consistent percentage display with proper decimals
- **getStatusColor()**: Standardized color mapping for status indicators
- **debounce()**: Input optimization for search and filtering

### Real-time Implementation
```typescript
// WebSocket subscription pattern
const { isConnected, subscribe, unsubscribe } = useWebSocket()

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribeEscalation = subscribe('escalation.updated', handleEscalationUpdate)
  const unsubscribeSLA = subscribe('sla.breach', handleSLABreach)
  
  return () => {
    unsubscribeEscalation()
    unsubscribeSLA()
  }
}, [])
```

## Business Logic

### Escalation Workflow
1. **Email Ingestion**: Receive email via API/webhook
2. **AI Classification**: Categorize email by type, urgency, complexity
3. **Rule Evaluation**: Apply business rules for escalation triggers
4. **Team Recommendation**: AI algorithm suggests optimal team assignment
5. **Notification Dispatch**: Multi-channel alerts (UI, Teams, Email)
6. **Timeline Tracking**: Log all activities and status changes
7. **SLA Monitoring**: Track progress against service level agreements
8. **Resolution Tracking**: Monitor completion and gather metrics

### Team Assignment Logic
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute assignments based on current capacity
- **Expertise Matching**: Match email type with team specializations
- **Availability Checking**: Consider team member schedules and status
- **Historical Performance**: Factor in past resolution times and success rates
- **Geographic Considerations**: Account for time zones and business hours

### SLA Management
- **Breach Prediction**: Proactive alerts before SLA violations
- **Escalation Triggers**: Automatic escalation when thresholds are exceeded
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor team and individual SLA compliance
- **Reporting**: Generate SLA performance reports and analytics

## Integration Knowledge

### Microsoft Teams Integration
**Group Management**: Automated creation and management of Teams groups for escalation handling, including member assignment and permission management.

**Messaging Integration**: Real-time notifications and updates sent directly to relevant Teams channels, enabling seamless communication workflow.

**Workload Visibility**: Teams integration provides visibility into current assignments and workload distribution across team members.

### Export System
**Template Engine**: Flexible report generation system supporting multiple output formats (PDF, CSV, XLSX) with customizable templates.

**Streaming Export**: Large dataset handling through streaming to prevent memory issues and provide real-time progress feedback.

**Scheduled Reports**: Automated report generation and delivery system for regular business reporting needs.

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay to reduce API calls during user typing
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand to reduce initial bundle size
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data sets in tables and lists

### Real-time Optimization
- **Event Batching**: Group multiple events to reduce UI update frequency
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient WebSocket connection management
- **Selective Updates**: Only update affected UI components, not entire views
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

### API Optimization
- **Request Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data in localStorage
- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple API calls when possible
- **Pagination**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Compression**: Enable gzip compression for API responses

## Security Best Practices

### Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper escaping of dynamic content
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for state-changing operations
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS for all API communications

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Access**: Different permission levels for different user types
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper expiration
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through request throttling
