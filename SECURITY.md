## Reporting a Vulnerability

The EmailBot team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send a detailed report to: **security@emailbot-project.org**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress every 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### Security Response Process

1. **Triage**: The security team will confirm the vulnerability and determine severity
2. **Development**: We will develop and test a fix
3. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure with you
4. **Release**: We will release the security update
5. **Announcement**: We will publish a security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
- **Never commit credentials**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- **Rotate API keys**: Regularly rotate OpenAI and Microsoft 365 API keys
- **Use strong passwords**: Generate secure passwords for all services
- **Separate environments**: Use different credentials for development, staging, and production

#### Deployment Security
- **Enable HTTPS**: Always use TLS/SSL in production
- **Update dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- **Monitor logs**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Backup encryption**: Encrypt all backups and use secure storage

#### Access Control
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Enable MFA for all administrative accounts
- **Regular access reviews**: Periodically review and update access permissions
- **Secure API keys**: Store API keys in secure key management systems

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs and external data
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries and ORM features
- **XSS prevention**: Properly escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication and session management

#### Development Practices
- **Dependency scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Code reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed for security issues
- **Static analysis**: Use automated tools to detect security vulnerabilities
- **Security testing**: Include security tests in the test suite

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest**: Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- **Encryption in transit**: Use TLS for all network communications
- **Data minimization**: Only collect and store necessary data
- **Secure deletion**: Properly delete sensitive data when no longer needed

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure model:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities privately to our security team
2. **Investigation Period**: Allow time for investigation and fix development (typically 30-90 days)
3. **Public Disclosure**: After a fix is available, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

- **Security Advisory**: We will credit you in our security advisories (with your permission)
- **Hall of Fame**: We maintain a security researchers hall of fame
- **Bug Bounty**: For significant vulnerabilities, we may offer a monetary reward
